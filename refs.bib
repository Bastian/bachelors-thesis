Our work combines the strengths of multiple recent approaches while addressing their weaknesses. Moreover, we leverage recent advances in word embeddings and graph degeneracy applied to NLP to take exterior semantic knowledge into account, and to design custom diversity and informativeness measures. Experiments on the AMI and ICSI corpus show that our system improves on the state-of-the-art. Code and data are publicly available, and our system can be interactively tested.},

The human nervous system contains cells, which are referred to as neurons. The neurons are connected to one another with the use of axons and dendrites, and the connecting regions between axons and dendrites are referred to as synapses. These connections are illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). The strengths of synaptic connections often change in response to external stimuli. This change is how learning takes place in living organisms.},

  abstract  = {Text summarization is one of the challenges of Natural Language Processing. Given the volume of texts produced daily on the Internet, managers can no longer have an exhaustive reading of current events, or progress reports from their employees, etc. They urgently need tools to automatically produce a summary of this flow of information. As a first approach, extractive summarization tools have been produced and there are now commercial tools available. However, this family of systems is not well suited to certain types of texts such as written transcriptions of dialogues or meetings. In that case, abstractive summarization tools are needed. Research in that field is very old but has been particularly stimulated since the mid-2010s by the recent successes of deep learning. This paper presents a short survey of deep learning approaches to abstractive text summarization and then highlights the various challenges that will have to be solved in the coming years to deal with meeting summaries in order to be able to provide a text summarization tool that generates good quality summaries.},
